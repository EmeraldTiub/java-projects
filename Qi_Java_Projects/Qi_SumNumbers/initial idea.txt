1. make a variable (currSum) that keeps track of the current sum  (starts at 0)
2. make a variable (currNum) that keeps track of which number is supposed to be added to the current sum (starts as 1)
3. make a for loop
    - for loop continues n times (n is the number given. n = 10 in the example)
    - add the current currNum to currSum
    - currNum++;

What if we want to give a starting value as well?
Set currNum to the starting value you want.

What if we want to increment by a specific value instead of one?
Adjust the line, currNum++, to currNum += [desired value]

What if we want a floating-point version as well?
