ArrayLists

- We've used ARRAYS in our projects; they have certain advantages like being fast
  and compact, but we've seen certain drawbacks with them, like having to code many
  algorithms ourselves (like sorting), and having a fixed size

- The ArrayList is a collection object that gives us incredible flexibility
  (no fixed size; add and delete items at will) and methods to handle many
  common tasks
- You can operate on an ArrayList as you can with many collections, e.g.,
  iterating through their items, sorting them, etc.

Sorting

- Some of what collections offer is "free" IF we do our part

- That can mean implementing some extra interfaces; luckily this is really easy

- As we investigate how to make sorting super easy, we'll learn about such an
  interface and the key method it requires

- Once we do that tiny bit of work, the rest is super easy
