Bubble Sort: "Biggest Bubbles to Top"

- Check each pair (i, i + 1) of elements in the array.
    - If the pair is unsorted, swap those elements.
    - If the pair is sorted, continue on.
- When you reach the end, go back to the start and check each pair again.
- Keep doing this until no elements are swapped after a pass.

Bubble Sort: Optimizations

- If we do a pass and make no swaps, we're completely done.
- We don't need to go all the way to the end each time, only
  through the unsorted portion.
- If we do no further swaps after swapping i and i + 1, the
  portion starting at i + 1 is sorted
