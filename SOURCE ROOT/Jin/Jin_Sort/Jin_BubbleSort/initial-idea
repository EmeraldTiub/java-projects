1. Pass in an unsorted array.
2. Keep track of the last swap you did.
3. Loop through each index EXCEPT the last index.
    1. Compare arr[i] with arr[i + 1].
    2. If arr[i] is bigger than arr[i + 1],
       then swap the elements. Update lastSwap.
4. If after that loop, lastSwap is still null, the entire array must be sorted.
5. Repeat step 2 n times where n is the length
   of arr.
