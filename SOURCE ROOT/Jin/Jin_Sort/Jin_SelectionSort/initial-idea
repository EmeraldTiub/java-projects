1. Loop through the array with index i.
2. For each index, find the minimum element to the right of it.
    - Keep track of the index of the minimum element. (call it minIdx)
    - Compare each of the elements with arr[minIdx].
    - If the recorded minimum is bigger, update currMin.
3. Switch that element with the element at index i.
