    - Get methods
        - getAge()
        - getFirstName()
        - getLastName()
        - getBalance()
    - Set methods
        - setAge()
        - setFirstName()
        - setLastName()
        - setBalance()
    - Constructor
        - age
        - firstName
        - lastName
        - balance
2. Use a Scanner to read in the data from the Customers.csv file
3. Skip the first line (it's the format of each line)
4. On each line, turn it into a Customer object.
5. Add each Customer object into the result array.
