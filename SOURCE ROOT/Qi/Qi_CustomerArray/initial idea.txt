1. use the Scanner read file
    - have a for loop that does:
        - reads the next line
        - makes it into a customer object
        - adds the object to an array
    - loop n times (n is the first line in the csv file and displays the number of customers)

2. "use the supplied Customer class" --> assume there's already a Customer class to convert data to object?
