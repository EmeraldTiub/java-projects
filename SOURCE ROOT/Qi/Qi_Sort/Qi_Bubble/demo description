[Bubble Sort]

- The basic idea is: biggest bubbles to top
- In each loop through the array (these are called passes), swap items that are not in order.
- At the end of the first pass, the biggest item will be at the end of the array.
- At the end of the second pass, the 2nd biggest item will be at the end of the array.
- And so on....

------------------------------
[Optimization]

- If there's a pass with no swaps, the array is sorted.
- Only go through the unsorted portion of the array, no need to re-sort sorted parts.
- If, after i and i+1 are swapped, no further swaps happen, the part starting from i is sorted.
