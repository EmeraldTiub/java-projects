[Original part]

- The maximum amount of times I'll need to loop through nums (the given array) is the length.
    - Use a for loop
    - Loops nums.length times
- I need to check each pair so use another for loop that loops through nums but not the last item.
    - "...not the last item" because it can't pair with anything after it
    - And it wouldn't make sense to pair it with its previous item because that was already checked before
- If item at i is bigger than item at i+1, swap:
    - Set a temporary value that is equal to item at i+1
    - Set nums[i+1] to item i
    - Set nums[i] to the temporary variable holding item i+1
    - Must use temporary variable because item i+1 changes to item i so later,
      if nums[i] was just set to nums[i+1], both items would be nums[i]
