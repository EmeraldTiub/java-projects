- Once again, maximum number of passes will be the length of nums (given array)
- Keep an int variable that stores the index where the next smallest item should go (call this moveTo)
- Loop through, find the minimum element
    - Also keep another variable that stores the index of the minimum value (call this minIdx)
    - If there's a number that's smaller than that variable
        - Reassign minIdx to the current index
- Swap the two items at minIdx and moveTo (unless the minimum element is already in place)
