[Insertion Sort]

- Start from the second item
    - Do that because the code will be comparing the current item to the previous one.
- As long as the previous item is bigger than the current item, swap them.
    - A while loop would work well for "as long as"
    - Make sure to keep a temporary variable for one of the items to swap
- Do this for every item in nums
