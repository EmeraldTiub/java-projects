1. For the original summing function:
    - Set the final sum to 0.
    - Loop through the numbers from 1 to the specified number.
    - For each of those numbers, add it to the final sum.
    - After the loop, return the final sum.

2. For the summing function with a specified start value:
    - Set the final sum to 0.
    - Loop through the numbers from the start value to the specified number.
    - Add each number to the final sum.
    - After the loop, return the final sum.

3. For the summing function with a specified increment:
    - Set the final sum to 0.
    - Loop through the numbers from 1 to the specified number
      but instead of adding 1 to the addition, we add the specified increment.
    - Add the addition to the final sum.
    - After the loop, return the final sum.

4. For the floating-point version of the summing function:
    - Set the final sum to a double with a value of 0.0.
    - Loop through the numbers from 1 to the number but increment by a specified floating-point increment.
    - Add to the final sum.
    - After the loop, return the final sum.
